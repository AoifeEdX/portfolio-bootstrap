# Portfolio in Bootstrap

## Description

This responsive Bootstrap-based portfolio is refactored from a previous challenge which used vanilla HTML and CSS only. It demonstrates what I learned from Modules 1, 2 & 3 of the edX Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development. It also includes some features I wanted to test out, such as hover effects, modals and icons.

### Features:
* The page features Bootstrap components including: 
  * navbar, 
  * hero section (using a jumbotron as specified by the course tutor), 
  * image cards displayed using Bootstrap's grid layout,  
  * skills section which lists the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp with Font Awesome icons, 
  * footer with newsletter sign-up, navigation, contact form and copyright.
* The page presents my GitHub username, an avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled image cards of five websites/applications; the majority are currently placeholders until I produce more applications as the course progresses.
* When the buttons on the cards for each websites/applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application; again, mostly placeholders to existing websites at the moment.
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to the user's viewport.
* Custom CSS was used to create some hover effects; for example:
  * text and hyperlinks change colour,
  * sections transform scale,	
  * buttons display a box shadow.
* Compared to the previous portfoio built only in HTML and CSS, this Bootstrap solution minimises the use of media queries.

## Usage

This portfolio is used as a starting point to represent my work, which I will add to as the course progresses.
